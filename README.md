# Sprint 4 Project STD

This is my project for Practicum's Data Analyst Bootcamp Sprint 4 (Software Development Tools).

The objective of this project is to use a car advertisement dataset as an input and to perform some exploratory data analysis (EDA) in order to clean and understand the most important insights of such dataset. In this project I also apply the knowleadge acquired during the bootcampt theory in using basic Python skills such as Pandas, EDA, Plotly, GitHub as well as Streamlit library to create web applications from Python. It was also a chance to use Render (online cloud application) where some of the insights and project's results/visualizations are be found.

The results of the EDA analysis on the vehicle dataset can be found under the notebooks folder in this Sprint-4-Project-STD project where a Jupyter notebook (EDA.ipynb) is located and can be opened with VS Code.

The Render web app for this project can be found on: https://sprint-4-project-std-ob8p.onrender.com/

Running the streamlit app locally will require to have the Pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit libraries installed in the local Python environment. In order to run the Streamlit app the cloned repository folder under the environment's terminal must be opened and with the following code: streamlit run app.py.
